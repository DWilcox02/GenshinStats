# GenshinStats
Parses Excel data through pandas, reorganises it as a dataframe, determines analytics and statistics. 

Initial excel was "Genshin Statistics.xlsx". I found his formatting of the data tedious, so "excelOrganise.py" was used to reorganise the data. "computeStats.py" gathers and outputs the various analytics into new Excel files.
